# ERRORS WILL HAPPEN, plan for them by making use of proper error handling in ALL the code you write.
# Anytime you write ANY code, write a test to make sure the code you wrote actually works.
# When using playwright mcp server to test functionality, also take screenshots of every page you entounter while testing functionality and save them in .gemini/ui/screenshots/.
# When you finish testing functionality, examine the screenshots and provide an unbias critique of the front end UI in terms of the user experience and save the review in .gemini/ui/reviews/.
# Use google gemini/vertex AI whenever the project calls for use of AI, do not use any other AI unless absolutely necessary. google gemini can generate text, images, video, audio.
# Use context7 to make sure you have up to date information on the different libraries and API's youre using, especially when encountering errors
