-- Seed data for local development
-- This file contains sample data to help with development and testing

-- Insert sample user profiles (these will be created automatically when users sign up)
-- No need to insert auth.users data as that's handled by Supabase Auth

-- Sample data can be added here for testing
-- For example, you could add sample books, personas, etc.

-- Note: User-specific data should be created through the application
-- since it requires proper authentication and user context

-- You can add any global/reference data here that doesn't depend on specific users
-- For example: genre lists, default settings, etc.

-- No seed data needed for user profiles
-- Profiles will be created automatically when users sign up

-- Add any other seed data as needed for development
